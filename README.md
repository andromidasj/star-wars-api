# Star Wars API

Built for Russ Nelson & friends.

## Getting Started

To get started:

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andromidasj/star-wars-api.git
   ```
2. Spin up a local or remote Postgres database, and get the connection details from your database. Make sure that the database is running and empty, as the API will create the tables if they don't exist.
3. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`, (or create a new `.env` file) with the appropriate environment variables, like so:
   ```bash
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_NAME=postgres
   # DB_USER=postgres     # only if you have auth enabled in the db
   # DB_PASSWORD=postgres # only if you have auth enabled in the db
   ```
4. Install the dependencies. In my case, I'm using `bun`:
   ```bash
   bun i
   ```
5. Start the server:
   ```bash
   bun run build:start
   ```
   (This will run the db migrations, build the app, and start the server. See `package.json` for more details.)

## Guided Tour Demo

0. Start the server using the instructions above.
1. Open your favorite CURL client (I'm currently using HTTPie) and make a `GET` request to `http://localhost:3000/api/people`.
   - See a list of all the people from the first page of the SWAPI API, with Luke Skywalker as the first result.
2. Make a `GET` request to `http://localhost:3000/api/people/1`.
   - See the details of Luke Skywalker from the SWAPI API.
3. Make a `DELETE` request to `http://localhost:3000/api/people/1/delete`.
   - Delete Luke Skywalker from the local database.
   - You should see the response:
     ```json
     {
       "message": "Entity with ID 1 has been deleted."
     }
     ```
4. Make a `GET` request to `http://localhost:3000/api/people/1`.
   - You should see the response:
     ```json
     {
       "error": {
         "message": "Couldn't find any people with ID 1"
       }
     }
     ```
5. Make another `GET` request to `http://localhost:3000/api/people/`.
   - You should see Luke Skywalker removed from the response!
   - Also notice that the current response has C-3PO as the first result, with data that includes the following fields:
     ```json
     {
       // ... other fields
       "url": "https://swapi.dev/api/people/2/",
       "name": "C-3PO"
       // ... other fields
     }
     ```
6. With C-3PO having an ID of 2 (that we see from the url field), make a `PUT` request to `http://localhost:3000/api/people/2` with the following request body:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Russ-3PO"
   }
   ```
   - Notice that the response has all of the fields like before, but now the name field has been updated to "Russ-3PO".
7. Make a `POST` request to `http://localhost:3000/api/people` with the following request body:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Josh Andromidas",
     "hair_type": "curly, poofy",
     "hired": true
   }
   ```
   - The response should show the entity type that was modified, the local entity ID (which is a number starting with "999"), and the data that was added to the local database.
8. Make another `GET` request to `http://localhost:3000/api/people`.
   - You should see the new entity added to the bottom of the list!

## API

### Tools

This API is written in Typescript using NextJS and DrizzleORM connected to a Postgres database. I chose NextJS because of its easy file-based routing, and I'm familiar with it. It's more of a full-stack framework, so if I were creating ONLY an API for a deployed project, I would probably use Express, Hono, or some other JS API framework.

I've been hearing amazing things about DrizzleORM, so I decided to give it a try as well to get connected to the database and make it easier to work with schemas and queries.

### Limitations

- **Errors**
  Errors are generally handled as to not completely break the API, but it could be improved to provide more detailed error messages for certain cases. I could solve this by using lots of if-checks on possible database errors and returning more specific error messages. For now, if there's an error I just respond with a 500 status code and I pass along the original error object that was thrown. My goal was to show that I know _how_ to handle errors, but I won't dig around for every edge case.

- **Pagination**
  Pagination passthrough is supported, but all of the manually added entities will be returned in the response no matter what page number is provided. I could improve this by compiling the list of custom + SWAPI entities, and then handle custom pagination in the server. For now, I'm just returning all of the custom entities and using the SWAPI API for pagination.

- **Modifiying deletions**
  Curently, there's no support for modifying the `deleted_entities` table. If you delete an entity and want it back, it can be added manually with a POST request. I could improve this by adding another endpoint which would allow you to "undelete" an entity.

- **Date formatting**
  The API doesn't currently format dates in a way that's consistent with the SWAPI API, since I'm just using a new Date() object. This could easily be fixed by going in and making sure that the date types are consistent, I just didn't want to do that for now.

- **Testing**
  I haven't written any tests yet, but that's something I'd definitely do if I were to continue working on this project.

### Routes

#### READ

`GET /api/{entity}/{entityId}`

The API is modeled after the [SWAPI API](https://swapi.dev/documentation) and uses the same naming conventions and GET URL structure.

For example:

| SWAPI URL                 | API Route                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| GET: `/api/people`        | GET: `/api/people`        |
| GET: `/api/people/1`      | GET: `/api/people/1`      |
| GET: `/api/people?page=2` | GET: `/api/people?page=2` |

> Note: I didn't add support for the [Wookie formatter](https://swapi.dev/documentation#wookiee). üêª

#### CREATE

`POST /api/{entity}`

To create a new entity, you can use the POST method. The request body should be a JSON object with the properties you want in the entity. For example:

```json
// POST: /api/people

// Request body:
{
  "name": "josh andromidas",
  "hair_color": "purple"
}

// Response:
{
  "id": 20,
  "entityType": "people",
  "data": {
    "name": "josh andromidas",
    "hair_color": "purple"
  }
}
```

#### UPDATE

`PUT /api/{entity}/{entityId}`

To update an entity, you can use the PUT method. The request body should be a JSON object with the properties you want to update, just like when creating a new entity.

This supports updating both entities stored in the local database and entities fetched from the SWAPI API.

For example:

```json
// PUT: /api/people/3

// Request body:
{
  "name": "R2 the bestest droid"
}

// Response:
{
  "created": "2014-12-10T15:11:50.376000Z",
  "edited": "2014-12-20T21:17:50.311000Z",
  "url": "https://swapi.dev/api/people/3/",
  "name": "R2 the bestest droid",
  "height": "96",
  "mass": "32",
  "hair_color": "n/a",
  "skin_color": "white, blue",
  "eye_color": "red",
  "birth_year": "33BBY",
  "gender": "n/a",
  "homeworld": "https://swapi.dev/api/planets/8/",
  "films": [
    "https://swapi.dev/api/films/1/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/films/2/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/films/3/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/films/4/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/films/5/",
    "https://swapi.dev/api/films/6/"
  ],
  "species": [
    "https://swapi.dev/api/species/2/"
  ],
  "vehicles": [],
  "starships": []
}
```

#### DELETE

`DELETE /api/{entity}/{entityId}/delete`

To delete an entity, you can use the DELETE method. If the entity is stored in the local database, it will be deleted from the database. If the entity is fetched from the SWAPI API, it will be added to the `deleted_entities` table, and the entity will be filtered out of GET responses.

For example:

```json
// DELETE: /api/people/20/delete

// Response:
{
  "message": "Entity with ID 20 has been deleted."
}
```
